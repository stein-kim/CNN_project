# CNN_project
Convolutional Neural Network Project

Project description: In this task, you will explore the use of neural networks to solve a business problem. You will choose between three different datasets and associated scenarios. You will build a neural network that is designed to learn data in the form of images, audio, or video using computer vision techniques. You will provide visualizations and a report, and you will build your network in an interactive development environment.
